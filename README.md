# Homepage
My very own personal website. Basically, this is just a résumé hosted currently with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) at [okovoko.github.io/homepage/](https://okovoko.github.io/homepage/).

Résumé is built using [Wiki of Volodymyr Kushnir](https://github.com/volodymyr-kushnir/volodymyrkushnir.com.wiki.git) so I won't add Wiki for this repository as long as I have no extra features. You can take a look at the [original repository](https://github.com/volodymyr-kushnir/volodymyrkushnir.com).
